After World War II, the first electronic computers were used mainly for scientific and military calculations. However, these were **isolated machines**, with no connection between them.  The idea of having multiple computers communicate arose with the need to *share information* and *resources* between users located in different places.
One of the most important moments in the history of networks was the creation of **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense.

**Main goal**: 
- *resource* *sharing*
- *information sharing*

The main problem at time was that at the time (*1960s* and *1970s*), computer networks were closed and incompatible with each other. Universities, companies, and government institutions used proprietary protocols that did not allow communication between different systems. 

**Main problems**:
- Interconnecting networks with different technologies (Ethernet, radio, etc...)
-  A common protocol was needed to allow data to travel without losing information and without depending on the underlying infrastructure.
- A reliable system was needed to ensure packet delivery and error handling.

 A universal method was needed to make heterogeneous networks talk to each other without having to change each underlying technology.  The concept of “**inter-networking**” was born, that is, the possibility of interconnecting different networks into one big network: the Internet.
